Hello!

I'm Zach, I'm currently studying part-time for a BSc degree in computing and IT. I have covered Java through my 
studies and will be starting Python, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, CSS, XML and HTML next semester. I've also learned how 
to use the Linux/Unix operating system as well as software development and basic networking. Next semester I will be 
studying a module on web technologies and a module on algorithms, data structures and computability. These two 
modules will complete level 2 of my studies with level 3 to follow.
